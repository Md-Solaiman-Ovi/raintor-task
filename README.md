# ‚úÖ Task 1 ‚Äì Developer Portfolio - Homepage UI

This project is a pixel-perfect, responsive React + Tailwind CSS implementation of a Figma design for a personal developer portfolio homepage.

## üîß Tech Stack

- React.js, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS 
- Component-based architecture
- LocalStorage for theme persistence (Dark/Light mode)



## ‚ö†Ô∏è Limitations / Tradeoffs

-‚ö†Ô∏è Partially Completed: Only the homepage is implemented based on the Figma screenshot.
- ‚è± Time Constraint: Couldn‚Äôt complete the entire design due to limited time. Further sections like Portfolio, Blog, Footer, etc., are pending.


# ‚úÖ Task 2 ‚Äì Real-Time Location Sharing using React, Leaflet & SignalR

This project demonstrates **real-time GPS location communication** between two users using React, Leaflet, and SignalR.

---

## üéØ Objective

- **User A:** Simulates and sends live GPS coordinates
- **User B:** Receives coordinates and displays location on an interactive map
- Communication is done in real-time via **SignalR WebSocket**
- Display powered by **Leaflet (OpenStreetMap)**

---
## ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Limitation / Tradeoff

### ‚ùó Map not showing in production (Vercel)

- In **localhost**, everything works perfectly.
- But in **production (Vercel)**, the map does **not show**, and only displays:

### üß† Why the Map Was Not Showing in Production

#### ‚ùå Problem
The application worked on localhost but not after deployment to Vercel.
The map never rendered because live location was never received due to SignalR connection failure.

#### ‚ö†Ô∏è Root Cause: CORS Error
Browsers blocked direct requests from `*.vercel.app` to the SignalR hub `https://tech-test.raintor.com/Hub`
SignalR negotiation and WebSocket upgrade failed due to CORS policy on the backend not allowing Vercel domains.

# ‚úÖ Task 3: Infinite Scroll - User Feed

This project implements an infinite scrolling user feed in React with TypeScript, fetching paginated user data from an API, using virtualization and graceful loading/error states.

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Limitation / Tradeoff
API Endpoint: The provided API https://tech-test.raintor.com/user/GetUsersList may return 404 if unavailable or incorrect. 

## ‚ùó API Issue ‚Äì Why Data May Not Show

The provided API endpoint: https://tech-test.raintor.com/user/GetUsersList?take=10&skip=0

returns a `404 Not Found` error, which means no data is received from the server.

This is why the user feed displays: Something went wrong: Request failed with status code 404
