# ✅ Task 2 – Real-Time Location Sharing using React, Leaflet & SignalR

This project demonstrates **real-time GPS location communication** between two users using React, Leaflet, and SignalR.

---

## 🎯 Objective

- **User A:** Simulates and sends live GPS coordinates
- **User B:** Receives coordinates and displays location on an interactive map
- Communication is done in real-time via **SignalR WebSocket**
- Display powered by **Leaflet (OpenStreetMap)**

---
## ⚠️ Known Limitation / Tradeoff

### ❗ Map not showing in production (Vercel)

- In **localhost**, everything works perfectly.
- But in **production (Vercel)**, the map does **not show**, and only displays:

### 🧠 Why the Map Was Not Showing in Production

#### ❌ Problem

The application worked on localhost but not after deployment to Vercel.

The map never rendered because live location was never received due to SignalR connection failure.

#### ⚠️ Root Cause: CORS Error

Browsers blocked direct requests from `*.vercel.app` to the SignalR hub `https://tech-test.raintor.com/Hub`

SignalR negotiation and WebSocket upgrade failed due to CORS policy on the backend not allowing Vercel domains.

#### Workaround:

- A **Next.js API route** is added (`/api/signalr-proxy`) to bypass CORS for **sending** data from User A.
- But **receiving** data (User B) still connects directly via WebSocket, which may fail if the server blocks it in production.

> ✅ This setup works on localhost, but due to backend limitations, **real-time updates may not appear on Vercel deployments** unless the SignalR server allows production origins.
